# Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

(_Provide details on whether or not you want contributors to communicate with you before opening a PR, if you require that tests be checked in alongside code, etc. Anything that you've setup as a requirement for your codebase is good to spell out here._)
